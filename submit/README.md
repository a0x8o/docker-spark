# Spark submit

The Spark submit image serves as a base image to submit your application on a Spark cluster. This may be either a Java, Scala or Python application. See [a0x8o/docker-spark README](https://github.com/a0x8o/docker-spark) for a description how to submit your own application to a Spark cluster.
